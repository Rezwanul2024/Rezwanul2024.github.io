        <h2>Rezwanul Islam's Cover Letter</h2>
        <border><justify>I have spent the last few years studying Information Science and Library Management, where I developed a passion for supporting others in having access to a wealth of knowledge and experience and an opportunity for social and cultural development. My relevant academic knowledge in Information Science and Library Management and my work experiences allowed me to understand the importance of Library customer service, collection management, classification, cataloguing and reference services in dealing with readers and researchers including official visitors, stakeholders, and service providers. 
        I completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Information Science and Library Management (LIS) from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2018 and 2019 respectively. After finishing my course there, I started working in the university's central library as an 'Assistant Cataloguer' where I gained practical experience in information services, cataloguing, classification, digital cataloguing using KOHA software and so on. Moreover, I was privileged to work in different sections of the library, including Acquisition, Processing, Reference and Circulation Services. These experiences have helped to shape my desire to build a career in Library Services.
        I enjoy collating information and conducting research which will be used to improve services.  I recently conducted my own research for my MSc dissertation on the ‘Role of Public Libraries for Immigrants’ Settlement in a New Country: A Case Study on Bangladeshi Immigrants in Bristol’. This research reaffirmed the importance of libraries within communities and reminded me how keen I am to ensure that all individuals can have access to the resources available. During my time as a ‘Reading Room Secretary’ in the student union, I worked alongside an organisation which focussed on blind, visually and physically challenged students in order to promote inclusivity. I am keen to embrace further opportunities where I can continue being able to celebrate equality and diversity by ensuring those with additional needs such as language, neurodiversity, and those affected by mental health are supported effectively. 

        Having worked in a variety of library service roles, I am confident in addressing enquiries or complaints and taking relevant action to meet the needs of library users. I work calmly under pressure and am flexible in my approach to dealing with problems which arise. I am also aware of my limitations in these roles and will refer or escalate where appropriate. Using my knowledge of library systems and my previous experience in IT facilities, I am confident in my ability to troubleshoot system issues that a client may experience and report them accordingly. My experiences in these roles and in my time on the university debating team have also allowed me to develop strong skills in communication and negotiation. I believe these skills to be invaluable when working in a team to support members of the public. I understand the importance of communicating efficiently and effectively to achieve goals and meet deadlines alongside meeting a variety of client needs.
        Being a self-motivated individual, I enjoy reviewing my own performance in order to maintain and develop my skills, knowledge and expertise.  I welcome feedback which can support personal development and service improvement, and I am confident in sharing best practices to support other team members. I am a loyal, friendly and trustworthy problem-solver keen to work within a dynamic and diverse team where I can make an impact. I feel that my qualifications in Library and Information Science, my experience in library services, cataloguing and classification, and my passion for information management ensure that I would bring an ideal skillset to this role and make a meaningful contribution to this service.
